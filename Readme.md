# POC : python lists in C
Author : Alexis Delavis (DAlexis1)
***
>#### This code is only designed as a proof of concept and as such you should never use it in any project.
If you still want to use it you can just copy `testliste.c` and `testliste.h` in your project and use the functions directly as there's no dependencies.
>This code only allow you to use dynamic 1D list for char, int or float but any other type could be added in no type with some copy and paste

Functionalities implemented :
* Create a list : the type for the list is named DefArray
* Free the memory used by the list
* Increase the list's length
* Append an element to the list
* Insert an element anywhere in the list
* Remove an element of the list
* Pop an element out of the list
* Get an element of the list : Only one by one, didn't implement slicing as I didn't have enough time but will maybe do it in some time
